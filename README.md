This repository provides a shell script–based automation layer on top of existing Terraform modules to simplify and standardize the creation of Rancher test labs across multiple cloud providers such as AWS and DigitalOcean. The goal of this project is to reduce the operational overhead of running Terraform directly by offering an interactive, opinionated, and repeatable workflow for lab provisioning. Using this automation, users can quickly spin up, customize, and tear down Rancher environments for testing, validation, demos, or learning—without deep Terraform knowledge. The script handles input collection, environment setup, and execution of the appropriate Terraform configurations, making lab creation faster, safer, and more consistent.
